### What is Litedoge?
[LITEDOGE- LDOG](https://litedogeofficial.org) (abbreviated LDOGE), (prounced as Light Doghe) LiteDoge is a free open source project derived from Bitcoin, with
the goal of providing a long-term energy-efficient scrypt-based crypto-currency.
Built on the foundation of BTC, PPC, NVC, and BLK. Innovations such as proof-of-stake help further advance the field of crypto-currency. But Proof of work will always be the best secure way the blockchain. Checkpoints and centralized nodes are points of failure with proof of stake.

# Development Process 

Developers work in their own trees, then submit pull requests when they think their feature or bug fix is ready.

The patch will be accepted if there is broad consensus that it is a good thing. Developers should expect to rework and resubmit patches if they don't match the project's coding conventions (see coding.txt) or are controversial.

The master branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed to be completely stable. Tags are regularly created to indicate new stable release versions of LiteDoge.

Feature branches are created when there are major new features being worked on by several people.

From time to time a pull request will become outdated. If this occurs, and the pull is no longer automatically mergeable; a comment on the pull will be used to issue a warning of closure. 

Issues with no commits will be given a similar warning, and closed after 15 days from their last activity. Issues closed in this manner will be labeled 'stale'.
